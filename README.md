Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
By: Monica Dodds

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends relating to the outcomes of to specific groups.
1) Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date [Located here](https://github.com/mododds/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_Vs_Launch.png)
2) Play outcomes based on percentage of successful/failed/canceled campaigns [Located here](https://github.com/mododds/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

## Analysis and Challenges
Using pivot tables and charts, created visual representation of:
1) Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date
2) Play outcomes based on percentage of successful/failed/canceled campaigns

Please see the [Workbook](https://github.com/mododds/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip) for additional information

No challenges arose from following the steps within the challenge deliverables

Possible challenages may include the ability to display the data in a meanful manor and not having the correct data to ensure our analysis is actionable


## Results
### Conclusions about [Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date](https://github.com/mododds/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_Vs_Launch.png)
1) With the exception of December, there is a strong correlation of both successful and failed campaigns to the total number of campaigns.
2) The month of May yielded the most number of successful campaigns.

### Conclusions about [Outcomes based on Goals](https://github.com/mododds/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
1) A line graph is not the best way to represent data with percentages; a stacked bar graph would have been more appropriate.  

### Limitations of Dataset
1) The dataset appears to be relatively comprehensive; depending on what you're looking to analyse, you are likely able to find what you're looking for.  
2) I did see country as a category, but smaller regional data was not available (ie: Toronto may perform better for plays than Nunavut, but Film may be more popular there. 

### Other Possible tables and/or graphs
1) Pie charts and stacked bar graphs work better for percentage based data.
